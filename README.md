## Getting Started

C is a powerful and widely-used programming language known for its efficiency and flexibility. To start programming in C, you'll need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or Eclipse. Once you have your development environment set up, you can write, compile, and execute C programs.

## Sample Program

Let's dive into a simple "Hello, World!" program in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This program demonstrates the basic structure of a C program. Here's what each part does:

- `#include <stdio.h>`: This line includes the standard input-output library, which contains functions like `printf()` and `scanf()`.
- `int main() { ... }`: This is the main function of the program. All C programs must have a `main` function, which is where the execution begins.
- `printf("Hello, World!\n");`: This line prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- `return 0;`: This statement indicates that the program has executed successfully and returns 0 to the operating system.

To run this program, save it with a `.c` extension (e.g., `hello.c`), compile it using a C compiler (e.g., GCC), and execute the compiled binary.

## Key Concepts

### Variables and Data Types

In C, variables are used to store data. Before using a variable, you need to declare its type. Common data types in C include `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `void`. Here's how you declare variables:

```c
int age = 25;
float height = 5.9;
char grade = 'A';
```

### Control Flow

Control flow statements allow you to control the flow of execution in a program. Common control flow statements in C include `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, and `switch`. Here's an example:

```c
int x = 10;

if (x > 0) {
    printf("Positive number\n");
} else {
    printf("Non-positive number\n");
}
```

### Functions

Functions in C are blocks of code that perform a specific task. You can define your own functions or use built-in functions from libraries. Here's how you define a function:

```c
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Pointers

Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are used to work with dynamic memory allocation and to improve the efficiency of certain algorithms. Here's an example of using pointers:

```c
int x = 10;
int *ptr = &x;

printf("Value of x: %d\n", *ptr);
```

### Arrays

Arrays are collections of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. Here's how you declare and initialize an array:

```c
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

## Conclusion

This Readme provides a basic overview of C programming, covering essential concepts and providing a simple sample program. To become proficient in C, continue practicing and exploring more advanced topics such as file handling, structures, and dynamic memory allocation. Happy coding!
